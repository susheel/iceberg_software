The latest version of Anaconda can be loaded with ::

Available Python Modules
------------------------
Anaconda Python provides a large number of Python modules including numpy, scipy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, scikit-image, ipython and many more. In addition to these standard modules, we have installed others following user requests. To see which modules are available, run the following command in an interactive Python session ::

     help('modules')

Installation Notes
------------------
These are primarily for administrators of the system. Anaconda Python is a binary install of Python. ::

  mkdir -p /usr/local/packages6/apps/binapps/anacondapython/2.3
  chmod +x ./Anaconda-2.3.0-Linux-x86_64.sh

  #Run the installer
  ./Anaconda-2.3.0-Linux-x86_64.sh

When the installer asks for location, use ::

  /usr/local/packages6/apps/binapps/anacondapython/2.3

Some modules were requested by users that were not included in the standard Anaconda installer. I installed these by doing ::

  module load apps/binapps/anacondapython/2.3
  conda install wxPython

Module file
-----------
location ``/usr/local/modulefiles/apps/binapps/anacondapython/2.3`` ::
