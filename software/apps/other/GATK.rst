The Genome Analysis Toolkit or GATK is a software package for analysis of high-throughput sequencing data, developed by the Data Science and Data Engineering group at the Broad Institute. The toolkit offers a wide variety of tools, with a primary focus on variant discovery and genotyping as well as strong emphasis on data quality assurance. Its robust architecture, powerful processing engine and high-performance computing features make it capable of taking on projects of any size.

Interactive Usage
-----------------
After connecting to Iceberg (see :ref:`ssh`),  start an interactive sesssion with the `qsh` or `qrsh` command.

The latest version of GATK (currently 3.4-46) is made available with the command

.. code-block:: none

        module load apps/binapps/GATK

Alternatively, you can load a specific version with ::

        module load apps/binapps/GATK/3.4-46

This module command also changes the environment to use Java 1.7 since this is required by GATK 3.4-46. An environment variable called `GATKHOME` is created by the module command that contains the path to the requested version of GATK.

Thus, you can run the program with the command ::

  java -jar $GATKHOME/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar -h

Which will give a large amount of help, beginning with the version information ::
