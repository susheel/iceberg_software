Mathematica is a technical computing environment and programming language with strong symbolic and numerical abilities.

Single Core Interactive Usage
-----------------------------
After connecting to iceberg (see :ref:`ssh`),  start an interactive session with ``qsh``.

The latest version of Mathematica can be loaded with ::

        module load apps/binapps/mathematica

Alternatively, you can load a specific version of Mathematica using ::

        module load apps/binapps/mathematica/10.2

Mathematica can then be started with the ``mathematica`` command ::

        mathematica

Multicore Interactive Usage
---------------------------
Mathematica has extensive parallel functionality. To use it, you should request a parallel interactive session. For example, to request 4 cores ::

    qsh -pe openmp 4

Load and launch Mathematica ::

    module load apps/binapps/mathematica
    mathematica

In Mathematica, let's time how long it takes to calculate the first 20 million primes on 1 CPU core ::

    AbsoluteTiming[primelist = Table[Prime[k], {k, 1, 20000000}];]

When I tried this, I got 78 seconds. Your results may vary greatly. Now, let's launch 4 ParallelKernels and redo the calculation in parallel ::

    LaunchKernels[4]
    AbsoluteTiming[primelist =
   ParallelTable[Prime[k], {k, 1, 20000000},
    Method -> "CoarsestGrained"];]

When I tried this, I got 29 seconds -- around 2.7 times faster. This illustrates a couple of points:-

* You should always request the same number of kernels as you requested in your ``qsh`` command (in this case, 4). If you request more, you will damage performance for yourself and other users of the system.
* N kernels doesn't always translate to N times faster.

Installation notes
------------------
These are primarily for administrators of the system ::

  mkdir -p /usr/local/packages6/apps/binapps/mathematica/10.2
  chmod +x ./Mathematica_10.2.0_LINUX.sh
  ./Mathematica_10.2.0_LINUX.sh

The installer is interactive. Here's the session output ::
